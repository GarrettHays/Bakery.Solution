## Description

This is a console program that was built using C# and simulates a user's interaction with Pierre, the owner of a Bakery. 
When the program runs, the user will be welcomed to the bakery and given a rundown of pricing for breads and pastries. 
Next, the user will be prompted for an input of the number of loaves of bread, and number of pastries they would like to purchase. 
After user input is received, the program calculates the total price using two methods for each type of bakery item.
The program then returns the total to the user, along with the rest of the interaction.
