#### By _**Garrett Hays**_

#### A console program that calculates total price of a users bakery order.

## Technologies Used

* C#
* .NET
* MSTest

## Description

This is a console program that was built using C# that simulates a user's interaction with Pierre, the owner of a Bakery. 
When the program runs, the user will be welcomed to the bakeryand given a rundown of pricing for breads and pastries. 
Next, the user will be prompted for an input of the number of loaves of bread, and number of pastries they would like to purchase. 
After user input is received, the program calculates the total price using two methods for each type of food.
The program then returns the total to the user, along with the rest of the interaction. 

## Necessary Tools

* MSTest (optional but needed if you want to run the tests)
* .NET (install using "dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script" in console)
